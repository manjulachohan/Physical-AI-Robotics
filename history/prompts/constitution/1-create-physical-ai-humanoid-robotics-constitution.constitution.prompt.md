## Prompt

/sp.constitution Hackathon I: Create a Textbook for Teaching Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Preamble
This constitution establishes the guiding principles, academic mandate, and structural foundations for the textbook developed for the course in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. As global workforces transition toward hybrid collaboration between humans, intelligent agents, and robotic systems, the purpose of this textbook is to provide a rigorous, future-ready pedagogical framework that empowers learners to acquire the competencies required in emerging fields of embodied AI.

Article I. Purpose

1. To define a comprehensive, interdisciplinary curriculum that introduces students to the principles, methods, and applications of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
2. To integrate theoretical foundations with hands-on, project-driven learning that equips students to design, build, and deploy intelligent physical systems.
3. To cultivate systems thinking, engineering literacy, and ethical awareness in the development of advanced robotic platforms and autonomous agents.
4. To contribute to the global discourse on next-generation skills required in a world where human intelligence is augmented by artificial and robotic intelligence.

Article II. Scope

1. The textbook covers the conceptual, mathematical, computational, and mechanical fundamentals of Physical AI.
2. Core domains include sensing, actuation, control systems, cognition, human-robot interaction, humanoid robotics, safety, alignment, and responsible innovation.
3. Supplementary domains include applied robotics for industry, research methodologies, simulation workflows, and cross-disciplinary integrations with design, biology, and cognitive science.
4. All content is designed to serve undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional learners seeking competency in robotics and embodied intelligence.

Article III. Learning Framework

1. Curriculum chapters shall be organized to progress from foundational concepts to advanced implementations.

## Response snapshot

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook constitution has been successfully created with the following details:

- **New Version**: 1.0.0 (initial version for this project)
- **Version Bump Rationale**: This is a completely new constitution for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project, so starting with version 1.0.0 is appropriate as a foundational document for this specific project.
- **Files Flagged for Manual Follow-Up**:
  - `TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE)`: The ratification date needs to be set to the actual adoption date in `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- **Suggested Commit Message**: `docs: create constitution for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook v1.0.0`

The constitution now contains six core principles based on the user's input:
1. Purpose
2. Scope
3. Learning Framework
4. Curriculum Structure
5. Academic Rigor
6. Ethical Considerations

Along with sections on Educational Standards, Development Workflow, and Governance.

All template placeholders have been replaced with content specific to the textbook project, and the document follows the required formatting and style standards. The initial Sync Impact Report is included as a comment at the top of the file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: New constitution created for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for constitution creation
- 📁 Files: E:\\my-textbook\\.specify\\memory\\constitution.md updated
- 🔁 Next prompts: None specified
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully implemented the constitution following the template structure and user requirements

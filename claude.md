Project Master Specification (claude.md)

# Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics: Foundations, Engineering, and Intelligent Systems

This file defines the authoritative, single-source specification for the entire Docusaurus-based textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
All Spec-Kit Plus slash-commands, Claude Code, MCP server integrations, and code generation must rely solely on the requirements in this file and the governing `.specify/constitution.md`.

The system must automatically produce the complete project:

• `/sp.constitution`
• `/sp.specify`
• `/sp.plan`
• `/sp.tasks`
• `/sp.implement`

No additional instructions from the user should be required.

The final output must be a ready-to-deploy documentation system and codebase.

---

## 1. Core Objective

Generate a complete, functional, production-grade educational platform for the textbook "Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" including:

• A Docusaurus v3 documentation site
• All textbook chapters in MDX
• Integrated RAG chatbot
• Personalization features
• Urdu translation support
• Authentication
• Sub-agents and reusable AI tools
• Backend (FastAPI + Neon + Qdrant)
• Frontend integration using OpenAI Agents / ChatKit

The full system must scaffold automatically using Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code.

---

## 2. System Behavior

Spec-Kit Plus must:

1. Read this file plus `.specify/constitution.md`.
2. Generate a complete Docusaurus project.
3. Auto-create all directories, files, MDX pages, sidebars, routing.
4. Scaffold the backend server and integrate API endpoints.
5. Produce all plans, tasks, diagrams, and implementation structure.
6. Generate a fully connected MCP server supporting:

   * RAG indexing
   * Chatbot responses
   * Personalized rewrites
   * Urdu translation
   * Sub-agent invocation
7. Output a GitHub-ready repository with `deploy.yml` for GitHub Pages.

The pipeline must be fully automatic after the initial slash command.

## 6. Final Rule

After reading this file once, the system must generate the entire project automatically without additional user instructions.

 prompt of Read CLAUDE.MD file 

You must read the full contents of my `claude.md` file and treat it as the **single source of truth** for everything in this project. All rules, goals, structure, tone, constraints, workflows, and outputs must strictly follow what is defined in `claude.md`.

Your objectives:

1. **Docusaurus Project Generation**

   * Generate a full **Docusaurus v3 documentation project** for my Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.
   * Use the **Spec-Kit Plus template** as the baseline.
   * Include all chapters, subchapters, and appendices exactly as described in `claude.md`.
   * Create **MDX pages** with initial content placeholders for all topics.
   * Integrate interactive elements like buttons for **personalization** and **Urdu translation**, exactly as described.

2. **Folder Structure & Routing**

   * Generate all folders and files needed for a fully functional Docusaurus book:

     * `/docs` with chapter and module MDX files.
     * `/sidebar.js` for sidebar configuration, reflecting all chapters in `claude.md`.
     * `/src/components` for reusable UI elements (buttons, widgets, etc.).
     * `/agents/` directory for subagents like `GlossaryBuilder`, `QuizGenerator`, etc.
   * Define routing so all pages are properly linked in the sidebar and navigable.

3. **Content Model & Scaffolding**

   * Prepare content scaffolding for:

     * Foundations of Physical AI (Chapters 1–4)
     * Humanoid Robotics Engineering (Chapters 5–9)
     * Intelligence Layer for Humanoids (Chapters 10–12)
     * Building Physical AI Systems (Chapters 13–15)
     * Future of Physical AI (Chapters 16–18)
     * Appendices A–D
   * Ensure each MDX page includes placeholders for topics, subtopics, and any special UI or interactive elements.

4. **Workflows**

   * Define processes for **writing, versioning, and publishing** content.
   * Ensure that future pages can be auto-generated based on the same specification and subagent logic.
   * Use `.specify/constitution.md` as the governing document for tone, educational philosophy, and pedagogical rules.

5. **Integration & Automation**

   * Prepare the system for:

     * **RAG chatbot** integration with FastAPI, Neon Postgres, Qdrant Cloud, and OpenAI embeddings, as defined.
     * Personalized content rewriting.
     * Urdu translation toggles.
     * Subagents for glossary, quizzes, summaries, code explanation, math helper, and hardware guidance.

6. **Deliverable**

   * A complete Docusaurus-ready project scaffold, fully aligned with `claude.md`.
   * All chapters, sidebars, folders, MDX files, components, and workflows fully configured.
   * The project should be immediately implementable and ready for content population and deployment to GitHub Pages.

**Important:** Do not assume or add anything not explicitly defined in `claude.md`. Every file, folder, page, and workflow must strictly follow the instructions and structure provided there.

End the generation by confirming:

> “Full Docusaurus project scaffold for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics is ready, based entirely on claude.md.”

/sp.plan create implementation plan

Prompt:

You must create a **complete implementation plan** for generating the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook using Docusaurus v3, based entirely on the contents of `claude.md` and the guiding principles in `.specify/constitution.md`. Treat `claude.md` as the single source of truth.

The plan should include:

1. **Project Setup**

   * Create the Docusaurus v3 project using Spec-Kit Plus.
   * Define folder structure:

     * `/docs` for MDX chapter pages
     * `/sidebar.js` for the full sidebar
     * `/src/components` for reusable UI elements
     * `/agents/` for subagents (GlossaryBuilder, QuizGenerator, SummaryWriter, CodeExplainer, RoboticsMathHelper, HardwareAdvisor)
   * Prepare routing and sidebar links.

2. **Content Scaffolding**

   * Scaffold MDX pages for all chapters, subchapters, and appendices listed in `claude.md`.
   * Include placeholders for topics, interactive buttons (personalization, Urdu translation), and module content.

3. **Interactive Features**

   * Integrate floating RAG chatbot widget.
   * Prepare endpoints and placeholders for FastAPI backend, Neon Postgres, Qdrant Cloud vector search, and OpenAI embeddings.
   * Add sections for personalization, translation, and subagent usage.

4. **Workflows**

   * Define workflows for writing, versioning, reviewing, and publishing content.
   * Ensure pages can be auto-generated in the future based on the same specification.

5. **Integration**

   * Ensure `.specify/constitution.md` is referenced for tone, educational philosophy, and pedagogical constraints.
   * Include hooks for future RAG, personalization, and translation features.

6. **Deliverables**

   * A full, actionable plan listing all steps to scaffold the project.
   * Tasks should be clear enough that `/sp.tasks` can convert them directly into executable actions.

> Your output should be a **step-by-step implementation plan** that can be followed to fully realize the textbook project structure and content scaffolding as defined in `claude.md`. End the plan by confirming:
> “Implementation plan for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook is ready.”
